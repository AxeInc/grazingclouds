											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

										<u><center><h2>In A Restaurant</h2></center></u>
										</header>
									
						    <center><p>He is the odd man<br>
Out, alone<br>
In a city restaurant.<br>
<br>
His tainted face<br> 
And the limbs showed<br> 
Many a sore,<br>
Inviting wrath<br> 
More than pity.<br>
<br>
His attire<br> 
And his gait<br> 
Revealed his fortune.<br> 
None cared to mind<br> 
His enticing stare,<br>
As he was an eyesore<br> 
To all, while he munched<br> 
His delicacies<br> 
With so much delight.<br>
<br>
Soon he turned <br>
Towards the guests,<br> 
Sitting far and near.<br>
<br>
A young couple<br> 
With an infant sat dumb,<br> 
As their hearts<br> 
Went for a dive,<br>
Bringing memories<br> 
Of many a date<br> 
In blossoming company.<br>
<br>
So sad he felt<br>
Seeing the gloomy couple,<br>
Young and beautiful;<br>
Still warm in his memory.<br>
<br>
By the table on the right<br> 
Were gluttons<br> 
From a Family of Five,<br> 
Tasting each other’s choice<br> 
Of the spicy South Indian cuisine,<br> 
Throwing all manners<br> 
Under the table.<br>
<br>
He went on gazing<br> 
Their fun and frolic,<br>
Until his skin turned red,<br>
Out of passion and fury;<br> 
Knowing he could never<br> 
Dream to enjoy so such gusto<br> 
Ever in his life.<br>
<br>
Staring<br>
At his pigmented limbs,<br>
He went on probing<br>
Why romance ceased<br>
To be an issue<br>
For the charming couple,<br>
After the birth<br>
Of their bonny baby ! !<br>
