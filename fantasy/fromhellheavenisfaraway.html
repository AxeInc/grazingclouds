											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

										<u><center><h2>From Hell,Heaven Is Far Away </h2></center></u>
										</header>
									
						    <center><p>In the Balkan mountains <br>
I was running<br> 
Behind flocks of sheeps,<br>
In front of my sweetheart,<br> 
Who never understood<br> 
My real faith.<br>
<br>
She was a charming girl,<br>
Who ever swore by the cross,<br> 
Saying Jesus died for our sins.<br>
For many years<br> 
We lived<br>
As best of friends,<br>
While I prayed<br> 
Five times a day<br> 
In my home,<br>
Up above Sarajevo;<br>
As we found<br> 
A fatal attraction<br> 
Brought us too close<br> 
To unite us<br> 
In marital bliss.<br>
<br>
Years passed,<br>
As we enjoyed our life <br>
In this creamy world,<br>
As neighbours praised<br> 
Our heaven on earth;<br>
While<br>
We nourished our faith<br> 
Deep in our heart.<br>
<br>
One day, my rustic daughter<br> 
Shot at me point blank,<br>
Asking why I did not<br> 
Wear a cross like mummy.<br>
<br>
I said:<br>
We are all men of God,<br>
And follow the sermons of Abraham,<br>
 Whether we call ourselves Muslims,<br> 
Christians, Jews,<br>
Or by any other name.<br>
<br>
It does not matter<br> 
What you are,<br>
So long as you are a Man,<br>
Practising a faith<br> 
Dear to you,<br>
Without harming any soul<br>
Or destroying<br>
What is God's Creation.<br>
<br>
I told her -<br>
Faiths may differ<br> 
But, we must<br> 
Pray to our Lord.<br>
<br>
As years rolled fast,<br>
Many things happened<br> 
In our mountain town,<br>
When the followers of Abraham<br> 
Became the worst of enemies;<br> 
Spitting fire,<br>
Not only from the throat;<br>
But from the mountain top,<br>
And the thundering sky<br> 
All over Bosnia.<br>
<br>
Days looked like years,<br>
As men brutally killed<br>
And cut each other With inborn spite;<br> 
Molesting and raping,<br> 
Thousands of young,<br>
And not-so-young women<br> 
In the melting pot,<br>
For no fault of theirs,<br>
Just because we belonged<br> 
To ethnic groups.<br>
<br>
As the gospels<br> 
Churned in the hearts<br> 
Full of melody;<br>
I heard a parady,<br>
Never heard before:<br>
None can love you<br> 
Better than thee;<br>
And bury thy neighbour<br> 
Without a wink,<br>
Fot the grater glory<br> 
Of our creed !<br>
<br>
The other day,<br>
I was in a shanty<br> 
And I could get<br> 
Nothing to carry home<br> 
To my starving family,<br> 
Reeling without water<br> 
And gas for many months.<br>
<br>
Then,grenades<br> 
Full of splinters<br> 
Were lobbed at us;<br>
Killing hundreds.<br>
And wounding many<br>
In a savage war<br> 
On an unarmed crowd<br> 
In the centre<br> 
Of our hilly town.<br>
<br>
There was no ambulance,<br> 
No police and<br> 
No rescue for the victims<br> 
For hours.<br>
<br>
In a crude hospital,<br>
Stone age surgery<br> 
Made me groan<br> 
In utter pain,<br>
As they sliced<br> 
My hands<br>
And the lower limbs,<br>
Till I fainted;<br>
Only to open my eyes<br> 
Hours after the torture.<br>
<br>
Without even surgical wool,<br> 
I was rotting,<br>
When my family came;<br> 
Only to be told<br> 
By those in the clinic<br> 
To carry me home,<br>
To make room for others,<br> 
Coming like a swarm.<br>
<br>
Back home,<br>
In our barren house,<br>
My only comfort<br> 
Was a craggy cot<br> 
Pushed close to the window,<br> 
Without even a shutter.<br>
<br>
I saw the meadow<br> 
Below the valley,<br>
Reminding me<br> 
Of our teenage romance;<br> 
While she went on<br> 
Counting her rosary,<br>
As the cross<br>
On her necklance<br> 
Went on dangling.<br>
<br>
From my death-bed,<br>
I saw<br>
The smouldering pine-trees,<br> 
And the blue sky,<br>
Cheering My inner soul.<br>
<br>
A whiff of breeze<br>
Suddenly cooled<br> 
My aching body,<br> 
Reminding me<br> 
That God was very much<br> 
Alive;<br>
As the leaves over the trees<br> 
Moved in ecstasy,<br>
With every breath of air<br> 
From our Lord;<br>
Perched far away,<br>
Watching the finale<br> 
Of yet another life,<br>
Here on earth.<br>
Maggie thundered in anger<br> 
In my dying ears:<br>
Dear, you will soon<br> 
Go away from us<br> 
To your heavenly abode !<br>
<br>
She gave me her last kiss,<br> 
Before my eternal sleep;<br> 
Little before the Angles came<br> 
To snap my soul<br> 
From my battered body, <br>
That was waiting<br>
For an unknown grave<br> 
In the land I loved<br> 
To live and die.<br>
<br>
As I closed my eyes,<br>
Did I hear<br>
The wailing prayers<br>
Of my beloved ones,<br>
As they went on murmuring....<br>
Ameen, Ameen, Ameen ;<br>
While a raging crossfire<br> 
From land and air<br> 
Left may country<br> 
Bereft of life,<br>
Like<br>
A hell on earth.<br>
