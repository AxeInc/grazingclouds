											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

						    <center><p>
There he sat,<br>
Waiting for his dentures,<br>
Charming me<br> 
With his toothless grin<br>
<br>
As he tarried his turn,<br>
He spouted a manly tale.<br>
<br>
Under the British,he toiled hard;<br>
Before the worst crush<br> 
Fell on his top.<br>
<br>
He was often warned,<br>
As he climbed the Ghats:<br>
Hope for the best, and<br>
Be prepared for the worst!<br>
<br>
The head injury sunk the forehead<br> 
Beyond the scalp, portending his nemesis<br>
<br>
At the Brooke Bond; the union he had<br> 
Was serene like the mountain brook.<br>
<br>
He was soon flown to London town,<br>
Only to return,<br>
Bouncing back full of joy,<br>
<br>
Years passed, as he enjoyed life;<br>
To retire in style,<br>
In the Venice of the East.<br>
<br>
He received his pension<br> 
On the dot,<br>
Showing with pride<br> 
A recent cheque in utter gleam.<br>
<br>
More than the four-figure dole,<br>
Gratitude was etched<br>
In every paper the company sent.<br>
<br>
That made the legacy<br> 
Of the Raj truely great!<br>
<br>
Still a bachelor,<br>
He detests the hassle;<br>
As he pause and wait<br> 
For his daily munch.<br>
