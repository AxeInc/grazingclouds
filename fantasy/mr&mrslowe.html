											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

										<u><center><h2>Mr.& Mrs.Lowe</h2></center></u>
										</header>
									
						    <center><p>As the setting sun<br>
Cast long shadows<br>
In the cold winter evening,<br>
We were approaching<br> 
The hill station of Nainital.<br>
<br>
While we climbed the steep roads,<br>
We saw love-birds, all the way.<br>
<br>
The romance we nurtured<br> 
Had elements of surprise.<br>
As we came down the valley,<br>
She stopped hugging me.<br>
<br>
Pleasantly, she put all her weight<br> 
On my back, rubbing and<br> 
Tickling me by her sensuous touch,<br>
As she rested on the pillion<br> 
Teasing and taunting me.<br>
<br>
I was itching to relax,<br>
Along with my sweet-heart,<br>
In the warmth of a hotel room,<br>
Up above the mountains.<br>
<br>
The Bullet carried us<br> 
Through the serpentine route<br> 
To the hill station<br>
Over the snowy peaks of the Himalayas.<br>
<br>
Our love was passionate, yet, tender.<br>
We were quite smitten,<br>
Like the lovers we saw<br> 
All over the land.<br>
<br>
There was no reason<br> 
To blink before the counter,<br>
While crossing the last hurdle<br>
To share the pleasures<br>
In the cosy room by the hearth,<br>
As we were burning<br> 
With passion,<br>
During the midnight hour.<br>
<br>
The message in the hotel<br> 
Registers were straight and clear.<br>
We were Mr. & Mrs. Lowe,<br>
For the rest of the world,<br>
While anchored in five-star luxury.<br>
<br>
As we entered the room, my sweetie<br> 
Chuckled with an infectious smile-<br>
“Are we husband and wife, dear ?<br> 
Though, cohabitation is a thrill,<br>
Is it not a sin, Lowe darling” ?<br>
“Nope” came the prompt reply.<br>
<br>
After stimulating drinks,<br>
Followed by a steaming meal,<br>
The mood was exciting<br> 
And, while the love-birds slept,<br>
Mrs. & Mr. Loy/e plunged<br> 
Into a wild midnight affair.<br>
<br>
The jazzy music and the smutty movie<br>
On the telly took their senses<br> 
To dizzy heights before the climax,<br>
 While drawing the curtain for the night;<br>
 After praying for fresh fantasies<br> 
To turn into reality, before long.<br>
<br>
“Promiscuity is very much In the blood of so many<br> 
That only a miracle can<br> 
Transform the gene within you”-<br>
Said the vice sage Of Kamattipura, long ago !<br>
So reminded the noble Lowe<br> 
Before they slept<br> 
On the chilly night.<br>
<br>
The Holy Book Was lying all night<br> 
Uncared, offering nothing exciting<br> 
Except the Lord's Commandments.<br>
