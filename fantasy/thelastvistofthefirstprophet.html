											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

											<h3> A tribute...</h3>

Adam,<br>
The father of man,<br>
Was seen greeting 
His family,<br>
Unfazed<br>
In his XL-Cosmos,<br>
Fully equipped to meet<br> 
Any eventuality<br> 
From the planet<br> 
He loved to breed<br> 
The human race.<br>
<br>
XL-Cosmos is much more<br> 
Than the Air Force One.<br>
It could travel Around heaven and earth,<br> 
With speed much.<br> 
Beyond light,<br>
With comforts,<br>
Befitting those in heaven.<br>
<br>
The Air Force One<br>
Will fly away<br>
Into thin air<br>
By the powerful blasts<br>
From the XL-Cosmos,<br>
Jamming<br>
All its electronic blitz,<br> 
Throwing<br>
The powerful incumbent<br> 
Down the Hudson river.<br>
<br>
Adam loves to travel<br> 
With lightning speed,<br>
To see us<br>
On our planet,<br>
Like a father,<br>
Iching to see<br> 
The welfare<br> 
Of generations<br> 
In human bondage<br> 
He conceived<br> 
In the garden of Eden.<br> 
Then, he knew<br> 
The temptation<br> 
Of Eve<br> 
Was beyond<br> 
The control<br> 
Of even the prophet<br> 
Within him.<br>
<br>
He could not mend<br> 
His sole believer, then;<br> 
Knowing fully well<br> 
His mission to reform<br> 
His offspring<br> 
Would require millions<br> 
Of prophets like him<br> 
For centuries to come.<br>
<br>
None ever questions<br> 
His paternity,<br>
Nor his materity<br>
<br>
Can we ever Imagine<br> 
Our real Papa<br> 
Is circling<br> 
Eternally within us<br> 
Just for our welfare.<br>
<br>
For all of us<br> 
He is real,<br>
As we carry 
Streams of blood,<br>
And the flesh<br> 
From the living cells<br> 
Of Adam and Eve.<br>
<br>
While motherhood<br> 
Conceived us<br>,
God Almighty watched<br> 
In utter delight !<br>
<br>
The XL-Cosmos<br> 
Is unique,<br>
For it can shrink<br> 
Into a ball-point<br> 
Or expand like a globe.<br>
<br>
The view<br>
In front of the pilot,<br> 
Who triggered<br> 
The human race<br> 
Gave moving pictures<br> 
Of men and matters<br> 
With heady sound<br> 
Like a TV hook-up,<br> 
Showing man<br> 
In many dimensions,<br> 
Giving<br>
The very aura<br> 
Of homo sapiens.<br>
The multi-colour<br> 
Mini-screen<br> 
Offers so much more<br>
<br>
The laser beams carrying<br> 
Clear visuals<br> 
In three dimensions<br> 
Probing deep<br> 
Into our body,<br>
Baring<br>
Our inner mind<br> 
And our very soul<br> 
With ease,<br>
Like a doctor<br> 
Scanning the brain<br> 
For a malignant growth.<br>
<br>
Grand-old Papa<br> 
Could divine all these<br> 
And more,<br>
Only to find<br> 
Ways and mean<br> 
To hug millions<br> 
He cares<br> 
To love.<br>
<br>
During his last visit,<br>
In deep torment<br> 
He saw A cute baby,<br>
Just born<br>
In a dingy shelter,<br>
With bullets<br> 
Sticking out<br> 
From her gory eyes;<br> 
Crying in anguish<br> 
Besides her dying mother.<br> 
Scanning beams<br> 
Brought the firework<br> 
In sharp focus,<br>
For all of us<br> 
He is real,<br>
As we carry 
Streams of blood,<br>
And the flesh<br> 
From the living cells<br> 
Of Adam and Eve.<br>
<br>
While motherhood<br> 
Conceived us<br>,
