											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

										<u><center><h2>The PM At Dawn</h2></center></u>
										</header>
									
						    <center><p>
The morning flight<br> 
Was getting ready,<br>
While the crew at Palam<br> 
Wait before dawn.<br>
<br>
At the abode of the PM,<br>
The household is agog,<br>
As he woke-up early<br> 
To drive far away,<br>
Without his clones<br> 
In a northerly route<br> 
Under tight security.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile,<br>
A PM stepped down<br> 
His palatial bungalow,<br>
To be greeted royally<br> 
By the orderlies<br> 
And his canine brigade.<br>
<br>
Minutes passed by,<br>
As he raced through<br> 
The streets of Delhi,<br> 
With no cops To guide<br> 
His limousine.<br>
<br>
The signals everywhere<br> 
Were flickering amber,<br>
For he had no reason to doubt<br> 
The fate of his mission.<br>
<br>
He must reach the airport Soon,<br> 
without any hamper,<br>
As a PM he had so much to do.<br>
<br>
A cat-nap brought him<br> 
Before Indira Gandhi,<br>
Where he saw gun-trotting<br> 
Policemen everywhere<br> 
With walkie-talkie,<br>
Busy with their morning core.<br>
<br>
As a well-known PM,<br>
He came tumbling down.<br> 
There was neither<br> 
A ceremonial send-off<br> 
Nor a 21-gun salute,<br>
As he climbed<br>
The Boeing waiting for him.<br>
<br>
Gracefully, he was ushered in<br> 
By those charming ladies,<br> 
Leading him to the seat,<br> 
Specially chosen for him.<br>
<br>
Soon he realized,<br>
He was not the PM,<br>
Though he was indeed<br> 
A Project Manager Of a growing company,<br> 
Turned multi-national<br> 
With the weight Of the might PM,<br>
And his petty cronies.<br>
<br>
As a proud PM,<br>
He was sitting pretty In the forefront<br> 
Of a Jumbo<br> 
Used by PMs alike,<br>
While they travel<br>
In the best of comforts,<br>
Without the dazzle<br> 
Of the Supreme Leader.<br>
<br>
Verily, the PM is a potential hazard<br> 
To himself and his companions,<br> 
Oozing little glamour and glitter,<br> 
As he race<br>
Through the problem states.<br>
