											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

										<u><center><h2>The Prophesy</h2></center></u>
										</header>
									
						    <center><p>The ancient kings believed their seers, while,<br>
Modem leaders heed to their fortune-tellers.<br>
<br>
When Manu was an unknown camp follower,<br>
A little known palmist, Rama Sastry<br> 
Of Kondanhalli Village forecast<br> 
That he would rule India<br> 
With authority,<br>
Befitting kings of the ancient yore.<br>
<br>
Shatri predicted<br> 
His spendid rise,<br>
With changing times;<br>
Using fuzzy logics,<br>
While looking beyond stars<br> 
That move here and there;<br>
Matching his wits<br>
With the science of numbers;<br>
To make his forecast<br> 
Perfect,<br>
Like a print-out<br> 
From a super computer.<br>
<br>
All went well, and the great Manu<br>
 Became the supreme leader of Bharath;<br> 
Consulting his Godmen, now and then,<br>
Only to confirm the future predictions,<br>
Some of which made him so uneasy.
<br>
The date and the time of his death<br> 
Bothered him greatly while his heart<br> 
Started ticking faster, as the appointed day<br> 
Approached, sooner than expected.<br>
He would die<br>
Early in the morning,<br>
On his 55th birthday<br> 
In the Rajadhani,<br>
After a stroke,<br>
On the dawn of the fateful day,<br>
In the year of his first term in office.<br>
<br>
Red alert was sounded,<br>
As the Prime Minister<br> 
Was confined to five-star luxury<br> 
In the make-shift VIP ward,<br>
Befitting a monarch about to die.<br>
<br>
At the stroke of dawn,<br>
The Regency and the entire nation<br> 
Was alive to the impending tale,<br>
As the electronic media<br> 
Relayed live commentories<br> 
Full of medical info<br> 
Released by a panel of experts,<br> 
While the PM stay put <br>
Meshed in an array of wires<br> 
Tagged to the monitors,<br>
Displaying on the screen<br> 
Every beat of his heart.<br>
<br>
The appointed hour came.<br>
The seconds ticked slowly,<br>
As the PM's heart<br> 
Went racing fast.<br>
<br>
Someone murmured:<br>
"The king is dead<br> 
Long live the king",<br>
As his companion corrected-<br>
It is our PM,<br>
For all our kings are dead and gone.<br>
<br>
Nothing ever happened,<br>
As the nation faced the ordeal<br> 
Tense with relief,<br>
As the leader passed the test<br> 
Beyond the prophesy.<br>
<br>
The country sighed,<br> 
when the leader Got up from his induced sleep,<br>
And his would be<br> 
death-bed In the ICU<br>
Inside the PM's residence;<br>
For him to complete his second term<br>
 As the Prime Minister<br> 
In the land of occult frenzy.<br>
<br>
The foretellers<br>
Rushed to the Rajadhani<br>
To tell<br>
Their leader<br>
How the horoscope<br>
Was Wrongly decoded,<br>
As his dotting parents<br> 
Had given vital data,<br>
Based on lunar calendar.<br>
<br>
Whatever be the flaw,<br>
Our leader is ticking strong,<br>
While all the predictions<br> 
Must now be recast,<br>
Knowing his present status;<br>
As Manu is still an enigma<br> 
To the teeming masses ! !<br>
