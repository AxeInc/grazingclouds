											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

						    <center><p>
The god almighty<br> 
Was whistling past,<br>
In bullet-proof cars,<br>
With royal comforts.<br>
<br>
The dark window-panes<br> 
Gave him only tainted views<br> 
Of the suffering humanity,<br> 
As the people stared<br> 
While the Minister relaxed<br> 
In heavenly gilt.<br>
<br>
The arrival<br> 
Of his Excellency,<br>
With a row of<br> 
Black Cats<br> 
In Gypsies.<br>
<br>
He had total security<br> 
From the people,<br>
Whom he loved to rule,<br> 
Though, he was<br> 
In the eye of a storm.<br>
<br>
Someone threw a rocket<br> 
Banging his car<br> 
With a mighty thud<br>
Sending shock waves;<br>
Ordering<br>
For a red alert.<br>
<br>
The driver<br> 
In utter confusion<br> 
Ran for cover<br> 
To a nearby shop,<br>
Leaving his master<br> 
To his own fate.<br>
<br>
The Black Cats<br> 
Went into action,<br>
Leaving many a dead.<br> 
While the situation Eased,<br>
They found<br> 
His Majesty,<br>
With his breed Inside;<br>
Panting for breath.<br>
<br>
None came to his rescue<br> 
On that Deevali night,<br>
As he was driven non-stop<br> 
To the All India Institute<br> 
With many more outriders;<br> 
Only to be declared :<br>
Dead on arrival.<br>
<br>
The Nation<br> 
Mourned his death<br> 
Caused<br>
By a flinging cracker<br> 
In utter freedom<br> 
By the urchins,<br>
As they yearned<br> 
To relax,<br>
Besides the shanties,<br> 
Out-side the city streets<br> 
Of the Capital,<br>
Better known to many<br> 
As the great<br> 
Indraprastha.<br>
<br>
A pall of gloom<br> 
Turned the festival of light<br> 
Into a chilly night.<br>
