											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

										</header>
									
						    <center><p>The cryptic warning<br>

Made him rush<br>

From his house,

Just before the storm;<br>

As a pot<br><br>

Of flowery plant

With a stench of death<br>

Crashed to the floor.<br>
<br>

A fleeting glance<br>

Showed him

Miles of kneel,<br>

Coiled

With hairy roots.<br>
<br>

The fallen plant<br>

Was bleeding for love,<br>

As he left it<br>

To the wonder care<br>

Of his charming wife.<br>
<br>

Rushing straight<br>

To the Trauma Centre,<br>

He was aghast,<br>

Seeing mangled bodies<br>

Of the bomb blast victims;<br>

Many with exposed veins<br>

And dangling arteries.<br>
<br>

Tiny roots he saw<br>

Before leaving home<br>

Was warning enough<br>

Of what was in store;<br>

As drenched bodies<br>
With sheets of blood<br>

Shooting from the hearts<br>

Lay bare before a crowd.<br>

He rushed to the Chief,<br>

Knowing well<br>

The anatony lessons:<br>

Our heart is unique,<br>

Showing the nobility<br>

Of our Lord;<br>

Least understood<br>

By our evil genius.<br>
<br>

Men forget<br>

The ever murmuring<br>

Flesh wailing wailing for love,<br>

As they poison<br>

Other's hearts<br>

For their own needs.<br>
<br>

Blinking;<br>

He knew<br>

The entire net-work<br>

Circulating blood<br>

Measured thousands of miles,<br>

Much more<br>

Than the profile<br>

Of Mother Earth.<br>
<br>

To save man<br>

Or his nerve,<br>

Was never so easy;<br>

As putting fallen plant<br>

Into another crate<br>

With little more of earth,<br>

And sprinkle of water,<br>

With a doze of manure<br>

To restore the damage<br>

Unseen<br>

By the naked eye.<br>
<br>

That was life, as it stared<br>

Before him on the afternoon<br>

Of the Black Friday,<br>

As he went on slicing<br>

Limb after limb;<br>

Never counting the number,<br>

Even for a second.<br>
