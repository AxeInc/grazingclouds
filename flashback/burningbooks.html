											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

The icy sleet, only the penguins could endure,<br> 
In the snowy mountains of the Balkan,<br>  
Crushed many in the race for Sarajevo,<br>  
And the siege of Bihac.<br> 
<br> 
A steaming cup of tea for the kins<br>  
Was just a dream<br> 
In a land locked for survival,<br> 
As ethnic cleansing<br>  
Invited hell on earth.<br> 
<br> 
Men were shackled not for any crime,<br>  
But for belonging to a different faith.<br> 
<br> 
Women molested and raped for days<br>  
Delivered babies in thousands<br> 
By the folly of heinous lechery<br> 
Against a human race,<br> 
By those who floulted the Lord's Commandment,<br>  
Even, as Vatican longed<br> 
To enforce the Cannon Law.<br> 
<br> 
To wash their blots and warm their flesh<br>  
Bosnian women saw nothing in their homes,<br>  
Except precious books, and<br> 
Bundles of paper left by their looters.<br> 
<br> 
Their hearts were heavy,<br>  
As they moved the books In trollies to the burial ground<br>  
To burn them on a chilly night,<br>  
Knowing the cemeteries were safe,<br>  
Not only for the dead,<br> 
But for the doomed victims of militia;<br> 
Seeing their desecrated homes,<br>  
And the besieged camps<br>  
So bestial and horrid.<br> 
<br> 
They sat around a country-fire,<br>  
Smiling and waving full of glow;<br>  
Throwing charred chests of superfine paper<br>  
Over fraternal tombs,<br>        
As they warmed<br>  
Their hearts in homage !<br>
