											<h3>About Mr. A. Khader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poetry had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that went on around him,he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that could shatter at the slightest shock.</p>

										<u><center><h2>Believe Not Your Eyes</h2></center></u>
										</header>
									
						    <center><p>In the land of coconut palms<br>
I travelled from dawn to dusk.<br>
<br>
The sultry afternoon soon passed,<br> 
Ushering the cool evening breeze.<br>
On our way to Cochin, once proclaimed<br>
The Queen of the Arabian sea.<br>
<br>
The twilight hours saw me<br> 
Swooning in the rear,<br>
Throwing my spectacle without care,<br>
Enjoying moments of rest I craved.<br>
<br>
Moments passed, as quickly<br>
As I slept, only to open<br> 
My eyes as we came<br> 
To a sudden halt, before<br>
A speeding coach on a highway.<br>
<br>
In front of me I saw a filigree<br> 
So beautiful, crafty and artistic<br> 
That I kept on staring for long<br>
Through my naked eyes with joy.<br>
<br>
I saw flowery patterns aglow,<br> 
While looking at carriages plying<br>
Below the yellow street lamps,<br>
And near the houses around me.<br>
<br>
The decorative designs I saw<br> 
Were twinkling stars<br> 
That have fallen before me,<br> 
Moving all around, emitting<br> 
Celestial patterns everywhere.<br>
<br>
While I closed, and opened my eyes<br> 
I found them to be real,<br> 
Before my senses could disprove<br> 
What I saw was a dazzle.<br>
<br>
Before long I dozed, dreaming<br> 
They were the modern<br> 
Horse brasses, well polished<br> 
To reflect light and distract<br> 
The evil eyes of those on the roads.<br>
<br>
How could my mind, least, accept<br> 
These horse brasses tagged to the fast<br> 
Moving carriages on the street,<br> 
As I should abide by better reason.<br>
<br>
Breaking my induced sleep,<br> 
I wore my goody specs,<br> 
Only to find these bright patterns<br> 
Were the shining lights, showing us<br>
The unending path to safety<br>
On a dark summer night.<br>
<br>
These were neither falling stars,<br> 
Glittering diamonds, kaleidoscopes,<br> 
Nor bright horse brasses, I had imagined.<br> 
They were the faddish electric lamps,<br> 
Blazing us through total eclipse<br> 
As we raced in the dead of night.<br>
<br>
I knew, my passions went wild<br> 
With so much confusion for a while,<br> 
As I saw the scenes before me,<br> 
Forgetting I should never believe my eyes !<br>
