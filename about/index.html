									<center><p>Poetic faculty is a certain shaping spirit of our imagination. It perpetuates moments and reflects eternal truths in a moment’s delight or pain. Nobody is likely to write poetry as a profession, more often it is a joyful indulgence. Mr. Abdul Khader was an architect and assessor trained abroad, he had knocked round the world to watch life at close quarters. He was not limited by the circumstances of his birth.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p>Born with a silver spoon, Mr. Abdul Khader continues a line of great ancestors, skilled, rich and reckoned in several walks of life. Poetry  had come a mite late to Mr. Khader, though involved in all that goes around him, he had yet a detachment which is a product of his invisible eye, a joy of life, an awareness of eternity, an acceptance that life is a piece of glass that can shatter at the slightest shock. Mr. Khader had a specific reason for his mind being set because he had suffered from birth from Hemophilia; his blood could have literally run out of him, leaving him high and dry on the unfinished shore of life. This daily alliance with death had inevitably made him a philosopher, yet he was not a cold recluse; he lived with great gusto.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p>Poetry knows no frontiers. English was only just one language for Kay. He had published books of poems in Malayalam, tender compositions that run and stop like a cradle hung down from a tall tree. One such volume is called “Manadan Kavithakal”, poems of Manadans; Manadath being the poet’s family name.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p>Mr. Khader was also at home with prose, needles perhaps to say. He had published a collection of biographies, one was an eminently readable collection of sketches of people from all continents of the world, people who left the world richer than when they found it. It could have been titled, “The Genesis of Greatness”. Kay had selected the plots or people so he could inform and inspire young minds.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p>Kay kept a low profile, he was not pursued by the stress and solicitude for fame that is sometimes the bane of some writers.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p>He sat in his own corner, harming none and helping many. His house is a little castle of comfort and good taste. He used to turn to poetry even between his busiest moments, it was both an orgasm and purgation, he has no rules except that of utter sincerity. Kay walks about barely touching the earth; one half is  sad and reflective, while the other is watchful and aggressive. Kay’s poetry is much like him, the collection published here are all smooth as pebbles; but of various color and size, the way a man with a poetic gift sees the world around him.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p>The poems selected for this collection are wisps of clouds, dark and light, they graze high above. They are all part of a changing world, so true while they stand still but have no value as they pass by. But the poems capture and perpetuate them, they are linked by fancy, a fantasy from beyond.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p>Kay’s favorite color was royal blue with a tinge of black. Roshna, introduced in “The Sprinkler” is his pet daughter, who at the time was just above the skipping age. “God’s Own Country” is a sad half-satire, it beats with love of the beautiful land the poet was born in. “Et tu Doctor” is central to his collection, it brings out the turns and knots that make the poet. We can only sympathize with him when he says that he went to the doctor and parked his “junk” before him; in the end, he says, the doctor probed his tummy more than his heart.</p></center>
